# Java guidelines

- Use appropriate access modifiers (private, public, protected) for class members.
- Use Java's built-in exception handling mechanisms (try-catch blocks) for error handling.
- Use Java's built-in logging framework (java.util.logging) for logging instead of System.out.println.
- Use Java's built-in collections framework (List, Set, Map) for data structures instead of arrays where appropriate.

-   Use Java's built-in concurrency utilities (java.util.concurrent) for multi-threading instead of manually managing threads.
-   Use Java's built-in I/O libraries (java.io, java.nio) for file handling instead of manually managing file streams.
-   Use Java's built-in networking libraries (java.net) for network communication instead of manually managing sockets.
-   Use Java's built-in XML and JSON libraries (javax.xml, com.fasterxml.jackson) for data serialization and deserialization instead of manually parsing strings.
-   Use Java's built-in reflection API (java.lang.reflect) for dynamic class loading and method invocation instead of manually managing class instances.
